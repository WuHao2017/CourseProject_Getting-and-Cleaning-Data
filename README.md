# CourseProject_Getting-and-Cleaning-Data

This repo contains three files as part of the delivery for Hao Wu's course project for the course Getting and Cleaning Data on coursera:
  1. README.md
  2. CodeBook.md
  3. Run_Analysis.R

README.md gives general introduction for the files in this repo.

CodeBook.md describes the variables, the data, and any transformation or work that the Run_Analysis.R performed to clean up the data.

Run_Analysis.R is the R script which developed to generate tidy data set required by the course project

Files in this repo will be reviewed and evaluated by other students in the same course.
