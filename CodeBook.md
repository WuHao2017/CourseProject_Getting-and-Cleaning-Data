# Code book for course project: Getting and Cleaning Data

This code book explained how to turn the raw data from several separated data files into the tidy data file required by the course project. It devided into 4 parts:
  1. Introduce the backgrounds of the data and relevant data files which used as inputs;
  2. Introduce available variables for each observations;
  3. Introduce the tidy data requirements of the course project;
  4. Explaination for the script how to turn the raw data into tidy data set required
 
## 1. Backgrounds and Data files used and the data in them

The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

There are x files that used for this course projects:
- 'train/X_train.txt': 

## 2. Introduction for the available variables
 
## 3. Tidy data requirements fo the course project
 
## 4. Explanation for how to manipulate raw data into the tidy data set required
